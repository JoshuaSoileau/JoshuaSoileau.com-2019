I recently tried using the Web UI to try to install [Magento 2](https://github.com/magento/magento2), but I was having issues on step 6.

```console
[ERROR] exception 'Magento\Framework\Exception\LocalizedException'
with message 'Wrong entity ID' in
/Volumes/Sites/my_site.dev/webroot/vendor/magento/module-eav/Setup/EavSetup.php:258
```

Still working on this one.
